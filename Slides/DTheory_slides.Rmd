# Goals of this Research

## Replicate the results of:

  * Bayesian Inference for Agreement Measures.

    - By: Ignacio Vidal and MÃ¡rio de Castro.

    - Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics, 2016 p. 809-823.


## The main ideas behind the paper:

Methods for assessing agreement between a set of paired observations has been well studied in the literature. Most of the studies have focused on using a frequentist approach to calculate several measure of measurement agreement.

## Assessing agreement between measurements:

* A way to assess agreement between two random variables X and Y is the mean squared deviation (MSD).

* Another measure of agreement between two random variables is the Concordance Correlation Coefficient ( CCC ).
